# Workflow
## Branching
1. Create a branch to work on your task. You can create a branch by "git checkout -b <branch-name>"
2. Make changes to the code in your branch
3. Once you are done with editing the code, issue a "pull request"
4. Wait for a code to be reviewed. (You can work on other stuff by branching )
